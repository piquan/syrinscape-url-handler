Syrinscape URI Handler
Copyright 2021 Joel Ray Holveck

This utility will send syrinscape:// URLs as commands to the Syrinscape Sci-Fi Player.  All you should need to do is just install it (using your package manager or `make install`).

This program is not a product of Syrinscape.  It is my own work.  Do not blame them if it doesnâ€™t work.

To test it, you can try `xdg-open syrinscape:///stop-all/` or point your web browser at the right URL.  To see debug messages, try running `/usr/local/libexec/syrinscape-uri-handler/syrinscape-uri-handler syrinscape:///stop-all/`.
